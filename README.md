# Sitters4Kidz-repo
FYP repository for version control and as a back-up.

For my Dissertation, I chose to create an Android application using Android Studio. The application allows users to create either child-carer or parent accounts and to connect with other users over the internet to find work/childcare. I used a Firebase Firestore database to store data for this project.

My full project can be viewed in the 'master' branch of this repository.
